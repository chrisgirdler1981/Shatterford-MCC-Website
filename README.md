## Description

this website was to be designed in a way that has a simple layout, much like websites from yesteryear. The users of this site both current members and prospective or other clubs are likely to be of an older generation, therefor I wanted it to be as familiar and straightforward as I could manage. It consists of four pages: Home, About, Gallery, and Contact.

## Pages

1. **Home:** This page serves as the landing page for the website.
2. **About:** Provides information about the club including its history.
3. **Gallery:** a gallery of images from present times and the past.
4. **Contact:** Provides a contact form and link to the clubs Facebook group.

## Objectives

1. To build a basic website for the club with a very traditional design familiar    to those of an older generation.
2. A familiar design and feel on each page for a positive user experience.
3. A very simple NAV bar identical on each page.
4. Images to cover background.
5. To showcase the history of the club
6. to link Social media to users. 

## Wireframes

The following wireframes give an idea of the overall look per page.

**Home**

I wanted the responsiveness to be of a similar layout wherever possible on a smaller device, just relative. I deployed bootstrap to help with this, I also liked the standard font which would work well with what I wanted to achieve. 

## Building

**Methods**

When I started this project it took me a while to get to grips with github and initially "codeanywhere". This was short lived as codeanywhere apparently stopped support, I then was instructed to move to Gitpod, which I did. This did mean starting again with a new template. 
I was using Replit to write alot of the code, I would effectively write the code and constantly test per page to get where I wanted to, then move the code piece by piece once tested and proven working over to Gitpod and version control/commits. This method worked really well for me as I had a playground, sandbox and safety net which is a similar concept to the LMS. 

**The Home page**
I managed to structure the page as I wanted with boilerplate, although I struggled to get the Divs inline. I managed to get position my background image which was one I would use on all pages barring the gallery. I also wanted to use an image underneath which was generic and of a relevant nature, I managed to find an image of standard rough tarmac which i set to repeat to fill whatever it needed to. It was nice and dark and a contrast to anything layered on top as long as the text etc was light. I created a footer which showed links to Social media and a back to top clickable link. I had trouble with the page content being covered by the footer, but I fixed that by playing with margins until it was right, this would be an ongoing theme throughout the site build. Standard responsiveness with this page was good so needed no intervention.

**The About Page**
The about page was mostly text with a couple of historic images included to break up the pure volume of text. 
Google photo's are where the images are hosted, they repeatedly changed the image address throughout the project which caused no end of trouble. 
I had issues with the footer overlapping text and I had to fix with margin values. 
I had problems with responsiveness on mobile phones so had to use a media qury to fix, this displayed the image in the same proportions as the the text section. Originally the text was in a narrow column and the image was enormous. i aso had to use a pseudo-element to add opacitity of a background colour over the tarmac background image to make the text easier to see versus the background image. I did want to keep the imagery however to keep the familiar look and feel of the site in place.

**The Gallery**

The gallery was my biggest test. Google photo's where the images are hosted repeatedly changed the image address, this caused no end of problems and rewriting. Initially I thought it was something I was doing but the image codes were definately different each time. 
I purposefully did not use a background image on this page, just the tarmac as I did not want to distract from the gallery images, it would have been way too busy. 
i then encountered more problems with responsiveness and columns so I reverted back to what I knew inspired by the Code Institute LMS, used a media query for smaller screens and it worked a treat. The media query I used to reduce the colums to two on smaller devices. i had to adjust the margin values to suit the footer overlap.

**Contact page**
The contact page is a simple form. I have used the code-institute formdump for submission in this case. I have separated the the page with Divs, you have one half being the form, the other side with some text and a good sized link to the facebook group. The social media links are also on the footer on every page but other than the facebook page the other social media accounts are in their infancy. I struggled with responsiveness so set a media query, on a small device the right hand column now appears underneath the form as previously it overlapped and looked a mess. I had to adjust margin values to stop the footer overlapping content.

## Debugging

**Home page**

The Home page other than as described in the building went through validators straight away with nothing needed. 
![validator home](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNrTwfuca4KbHIs5xTB71c-rFf6fcGP_tID98l8WplloS3d7SeaSSICncs7gYGa0ttRAvm2H-neqmfFhbLPMRA4_MgqlDEdC3y2PqkIlCPER1DL8NZFvlkIjbUequY9NHkEj8Vvp5wmtef0sbECbwMs=w1366-h517-s-no-gm?authuser=1)

**About page**

This page also went straight through the validator.

**Gallery**

Validating the gallery gave me alot of problems, originally flags came up that there were no alts, which i did not want to use for a gallery. I settled for one alt per section and the rest were empty but there nonetheless. 
The other issue I had was that the validator flagged that I had no heading in the section. The heading was just above the section to separate, so not actually accurate. There was also a problem with an unclosed div which I fixed.

**Contact page**

There was a problem with an unclosed div which I had to fix, otherwise this was good.
