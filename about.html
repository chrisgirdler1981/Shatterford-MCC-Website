    <h2 id="about-title">A brief history of Shatterford MCC</h2>
    <p>In 1973, four motorcycling friends met at the Park Attwood Hotel near
    Trimpley, Bewdley. All were keen motorcyclists, their interest was to
    meet and organise joint rally activities, and travel together or meet at
    venues, this they did for the 1974 season. It soon became clear that
    other local friends would like to join in the “club”.
    In 1975 the “four” decided to inaugurate Shatterford Motorcycle Club, so
    named since the Hamlet of Shatterford was the nearest local point to
    the Park Attwood, Bewdley already had a club which concentrated
    mainly on sports, there was no real venue in Trimpley, and was too far
    from Stourport-on-Severn, whose name would have been too long, so
    Shatterford it was, then and you could find it easily on the map.
    After a short while, the owners of the Park Attwood, decided that
    business was not any longer viably profitable so decided to close, and
    became a fine nursing home. A new venue was sought.........
    We go then to a familiar place in the venue world, known for it's disco
    and live entertainment featuring granny grabbing......The Nautical
    William........Since much of the venues' activities were mainly
    Thursday,Friday & Saturday, with weekday resturant and drinks, a
    Tuesday evening full of motorcycles might boost profits, the club was
    offered the Cellar Bar as it's own club room..Bingo... the club prepared
    the room and Tuesday was Shatterford MCC Night, away from the posh
    populus of the resturant and lounge, and it's own section of car park the
    numbers began to increase as more local riders became interested.</p>

    <p>Shatterford MCC swelled to be a fine club, It's constitution as a rallyist
    club always present and this was the main occupation on fairly all
    weekends, rain, shine and...snow! Wonderfully great and memorable
    times were had. In 1976 the club had became well known in
    motorcycling circles, enough so an approach was made from the
    County Road Safety Officer, John Darlington. In an effort to curb the
    fairly substantial number of serious road incidents and deaths to the
    vulnerable 16 and 17 year olds on their fast fizzies and kawasaki 250's
    etc. the club was asked if it would like to provide some basic training
    funded by the council to the younger elements, and others of the wyre
    forest district......So a training scheme was born.......

    Members of the club undertook instructor training provided jointly by
    Worcs.C.C. And the highly skilled motorcycle section of West Mercia
    Constabulary, and initiated training at George Street School,
    Kidderminster on Saturday mornings. Attendance was good overall,
    many young riders benefiting from the experiences of real motorcyclists,
    and a great recruitment tool too. Riders came from all around wyre
    forest and the North Worcestershire environs too....Namely Stourbridge
    and Hagley, both areas would become the provider of many notable
    club members.</p>

    and funds the club organised it's own rally.... The Sheep Naggers
    Rally....Staged at a few various venues, the Naggers was always a well
    attended invite only rally, the 1978 one being held at our own clubhouse
    and much fun had by all. The kind farmer providing the camping land
    behind the now named Fenn Green.

    About the turn of the next decade, the 80's, the rival, if you could call
    them that, Star Rider, which was a paid-for training group, became
    more prominent nationally, with the proposed introduction of the now
    necessary CBT, funding now much reduced from the financially
    struggling Hereford and Worcester CC. The club was forced to consider
    some form of merger with Star Rider. The feeling was that we were a
    Rally Club foremost, so motorcycling was our game, the training could
    now be left with those who were making it their preferred skill and
    activity, so back to our original formation....
    the Rally etc. the club is proud though, that one of our instructors did
    indeed become Kidderminsters' best known CBT instructor as a result of
    all that, and is responsible for many riders now.

    The well supported club had became a well known entity in the
    motorcycle world, but was dealt a blow when the owner of the Fenn
    Green decided to sell since the only well supported evening was indeed
    the Tuesday MCC, good though it was, it couldn't support the rest of the
    weeks necessary takings. The Fenn closed in 1987 so a new venue
    was sought.

    Tuesday at the Nurses Home Kidderminster General Hospital !
    Brilliant. Visit anyone who might have had a fall, then onto the clubroom
    at the nurses quarters for club nite.
    The club survived for some time here before the Local Area Health
    Authority decided that nurses didn't need to have subsidised housing,
    sold the lot off, which eventually became Hume Street Medical Centre.
    The club sought yet another venue.............
    The King Billy, Crane Street, Here the club continued for some years,
    being a meeting place for those left as members. The large membership
    of the 70's reducing as those got married, had babies, no more
    explanation needed. Another concern for the club's membership was
    indeed the fact that the now CBT, and the keeness of new 'ped riders
    lasted only until a car licence could be obtained.
    The club continues. After the demise of the King Billy, a new venue was
    sought..........The Weary Traveller. Not too far from the old venue of the
    Nurses Home, The club met now with a lot fewer numbers, but still met.
    The club was looked after by our landlord Chris, sadly, he did pass
    away, the future of the 'Traveller being in doubt a new venue was
    sought..........
    The Castle, Park Street..........is now our regular meeting place, and
    indeed our current home. This happens on the first Tuesday every
    month from 19:30. </p>
